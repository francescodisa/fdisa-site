    "Graduated in Philosophy, Francesco D’Isa is the author of essays and novels published by Hoepli, effequ, Tunué, Newton Compton, and Edizioni Tlon. Over the years, he has gained extensive experience as a theorist and popularizer in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and creativity, as well as a digital artist. His artistic work stands out for its highly distinctive aesthetics, the result of exceptional skill in prompt writing and generating images and figures whose unique style is often the outcome of errors deliberately guided by D’Isa himself.\nRecently, he published the illustrated \"philosophy novel\" Sunyata (Eris Edizioni) and The Algorithmic Revolution of Images (Sossella Editore, 2024). Editorial director of the cultural magazine L’Indiscreto, D’Isa writes and draws for various Italian and international magazines. His works are increasingly exhibited in shows both in Italy and abroad. He is currently a Philosophy professor at the Lorenzo de’ Medici Institute (Florence) and teaches Illustration and Contemporary Plastic Techniques at LABA Brescia.\nEmail me at francesco.disa(at)gmail.com"
